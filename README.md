# Simple-Calculator
HTML , CSS
The HTML code creates a functional and visually appealing calculator using HTML and CSS. The document begins with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and includes essential meta tags for character encoding and responsive design. The CSS styles the calculator to be centered on the page with a distinct look, featuring a box-shadow, rounded corners, and a border to define the calculatorâ€™s boundaries. The .calculator class ensures the container is appropriately sized and styled with padding and shadow effects to enhance its appearance. The input field, styled with .calculator input, is set to be fully width-adjusted with a clear, readable text display for calculations and results. Buttons within the calculator are uniformly styled with .calculator button, but those with the .operator class have a different background to signify their function. Specific IDs (#jk and #kn) are used to further customize button appearance, including colors and margins for better visual differentiation. The background image applied to the body covers the entire viewport, adding a modern touch to the design. Inside the <body>, the header displays the calculator's title prominently, followed by the main calculator container. This container houses an input field for dynamic display of user input and results, along with multiple rows of buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), a decimal point, an equal sign for calculating results, and a clear button. Each button's onclick attribute manipulates the input field directly or performs calculations via JavaScript's eval() function, which evaluates the input string as a mathematical expression. The design aims for a clean, user-friendly interface that facilitates basic arithmetic operations while ensuring ease of use through well-defined button actions and a visually appealing layout.
